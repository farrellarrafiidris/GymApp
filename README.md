# GymApp

GymApp is a fitness tracking application built using React. It allows users to track their workouts, set fitness goals, and monitor progress over time.

## Features

- **Workout Generator**: Generates workout routines based on user preferences (e.g., strength training, cardio).
- **Progress Tracker**: Allows users to log their workouts and track their progress over time.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works across all devices and screen sizes.
- **React Components**: Modular, reusable React components for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for state and effect management.
- **Local Storage**: Saves user workout data locally in the browser, so the data persists even after page refresh.
